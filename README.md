# Features
Vehicle Tracking: The simulation provides real-time tracking of vehicles, enabling users to monitor their locations and movements.

Blockchain-based Communication: Blockchain technology is employed for secure and decentralized communication between vehicles. This ensures data privacy, and integrity, and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
	
Vehicle Data Management: The simulation effectively manages vehicle data, storing crucial information such as vehicle identification, location history, and communication logs.

Vehicle Trust Scores: Each vehicle is assigned a trust score based on its reliability and behavior. These trust scores help users assess the credibility of a vehicle in the network.

Message Reliability Analysis: The simulation incorporates advanced algorithms to analyze the reliability of communication messages exchanged between vehicles. Achieving an accuracy of over 90%, this analysis provides valuable insights into the trustworthiness of messages.
